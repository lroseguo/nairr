How To Contribute to NAIRR Community Resources Documentation
============================================================

#. Fork the NAIRRPilot/nairr repository (https://github.com/NAIRRProgram/nairr) and create a working branch.

    #.  Click on the "Fork" button near the top-right of the repository page.

        * You only need to fork the repository once. If already forked during a previous change, skip this step and move on to creating a branch.

        .. image:: /images/contributing/NAIRR_fork-repo-closeup.png
           :alt: A close-up of the 'Fork' button. Beneath it is the text 'Fork your own copy of NAIRRProgram/nairr.'

    #.  Double-check that the owner is your account, and if desired modify the repository name and description, then click "Create fork." The page will be redirected to the new fork.

        .. image:: /images/contributing/NAIRR_create-new-fork.png
           :alt: The 'Create a new fork' page.

    #.  Click on the branch drop-down near the top-left of the forked repository and ensure that the branch you want to branch from is selected (typically 'main'). Type in a name for a new branch, then click "Create branch <your-branch-name> from <originating branch>." The page will reload with the new branch name displayed in the drop-down menu.

#.  Make edits in Codespaces

    #.  Click on the green 'Code' dropdown above the project files on the right side.

        .. image:: /images/contributing/NAIRR_code-start.png
           :alt: Top-level NAIRRProgram/nairr code page.

    #.  Click on ‘Codespaces’ tab if to switch from the 'Local' tab if not already selected.

    #.  Click on ‘Create new codespace on main’ if none exist.

        *  If there are any codespaces already available, they will be shown here in place of the button to create a new codespace. In this case, create a new codespace by clicking the plus sign, or use an existing codespace by clicking the three dots across from the name and selecting 'Open in Browser'.

         .. image:: /images/contributing/NAIRR_codespaces-open-in-browser.png
            :alt: Options menu for opening existing codespace.

    #.  If prompted to periodically git Fetch by a notification at the bottom-right of the codespace, click ‘Yes’.

#.  Make changes

    #.  Docs are mostly in /docs/source/ - edit existing files by selecting them in the explorer, or create new files by clicking the 'New File' icon near the top of the file explorer.

        .. image:: /images/contributing/NAIRR_codespaces-file-explorer.png
           :alt: Codespaces file explorer.

    #.  For example, create 'mynewdoc.rst' as a sibling to 'index.rst'

        .. image:: /images/contributing/NAIRR_name-new-file.png
           :alt: New file being named in the file explorer.

    #.  In table of contents in 'index.rst', add new link to 'mynewdoc'.

        .. image:: /images/contributing/NAIRR_exampledoc-index.png
           :alt: File name of example document being added to the index.

    #.  Add your content in 'mynewdoc.rst'

           :alt: Example text added to a new file.

#.  Preview local build (builds automatically on changes)

    #.  Click on the Codespaces terminal in the bottom pane
    #.  By default, the codespace will probably load the terminal in the /workspaces/nairr directory. Run "cd docs" to move down into the docs directory where the Makefile is.

        .. image:: /images/contributing/NAIRR_cd-to-docs.png
           :alt: cd to docs in the codespaces terminal.
        
        *  If the codespace is already running an http server in the terminal, then to use the terminal either select an unused bash instance to the right of the terminal, create a new instance using the plus sign, or stop the server with Ctrl+C.

           .. image:: /images/contributing/NAIRR_http-server-running.png

           .. image:: /images/contributing/NAIRR_select-bash-instance.png
              :alt: Bash instances already running.

    #.  From the docs directory, run "make html" to build the project.

        .. image:: /images/contributing/NAIRR_make-html.png
           :alt: Building the project with Make.

    #.  Serve the project by running "python -mhttp.server".

        .. image:: /images/contributing/NAIRR_mhttp-server.png
           :alt: Serving the ReadTheDocs build.

        *  The codespace may launch the server automatically when opened, as indicated by the opening of a web browser in the codespace and the presence of a process already running in the terminal. When this is the case, "python -mhttp.server" will fail as the address is already in use. The server will launch automatically after rebuilding the project and refreshing the browser tab viewing the documentation.

    #.  View the build by opening it in a browser tab. This can be done by:

        *  Hovering over the URL in the terminal output (http://0.0.0.0:8000/), clicking "Follow link," and selecting "Open" when prompted,

           .. image:: /images/contributing/NAIRR_mhttp-server-full.png

              :alt: A prompt to allow Code to open an external website which it is serving.
         
        *  or by selecting the ports tab and clicking the globe icon.

    #.  After making additional edits, repeat the "make html" command and refresh the preview browser tab to preview new changes.

        * If the 'Create' button is faded and can't be clicked, it may be because you are trying to merge from 'NAIRRProgram/nairr' which you may not have permission to do. If you have not yet created a branch, you will need to do so.

    #.  Click 'Create.' a tab should open in the codespace to the newly-created pull request.
